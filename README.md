# TBC-Mat-Calculator
A calculator that finds the specific amount of materials needed to make certain annoying items in World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade
I am coding this in Mircosoft Visual Studio 2019 using C++.
If you do not have/do not know how to use Visual Studio, you can copy paste the code from main.cpp into this online C++ compiler.
